This folder contains resources including image, scripts, and a template project file used to create the watch faces.  

The AHK files are macros and text databases for quickly selecting sprite groupings and creating builds in Watch Face Studio - these macros are pretty specific to my computer and unlikely to work elsewhere, only uploaded for my backup and reference.  

The image zip files contain the character sprites, backgrounds, and UI elements used in the watch faces.

The project template file is the "base" watch face that was copied and then modified to create each variant of the watch face.
